Hello there, I’m @RubenFrans
I'm a game developer driven by passion.
While being in love with all aspects surrounding games I focus on the technical side of game development.
I am always excited to learn about new technologies, techniques or innovations in Engine and Gameplay programming. 
While keeping the soft spot in my heart for Graphics programming warm.
